For climbers with flat feet, finding the right pair of climbing shoes can be a challenge.

## What Are Flat Feet?

Flat feet, also known as flatfoot, is a condition in which the arch of the foot collapses, causing the sole of the foot to come into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. Flat feet can result from a variety of factors, including genetics, aging, injury, and overuse.

People with flat feet often experience pain, discomfort, and reduced mobility, and these problems can be compounded by the demands of climbing. Flat feet can make it more difficult to maintain balance and control, and they can also increase the risk of injury and fatigue.
